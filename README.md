# Internatinal Matches Prediction

A model that predicts the outcome of international football fixtures considering the following factors: Rank and whether the team is playing at home or away.


#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective

Mchezopesa, an online betting platform, is looking for a model to predict match outcomes for international fixtures. The prediction will be based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly.

### Methods Used
* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model
* Cross-validate the model
* Compute RMSE
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity 
* using Bartlettâ€™s test

## Project Description

A logistic or polynomial model that predicts the outcome of an international football match recognised by FIFA.

## Getting Started

The results data is a list of all FIFA recognised international football matches between November 1872 and July 2019, while the rank data includes FIFA ranking of member federations between August 1993 and June 2018. To be able to use the data to make a prediction, the data needs to be combined for the periods that contain all the data required ie. rank, home score and away score, this means only working with data from August 1993 to June 2018.
